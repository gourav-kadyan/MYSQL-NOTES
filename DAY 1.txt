SQL --- STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE

RDBMS -- RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
   LIKE -- MySQL , Oracle, Ms sql server, PostrgreSql etc

So what sql do --> 
	the main work of sql is that like we have database and so to interact with database --> edit data of database
	we use sql for it --> like CRUD operations -- > create, read, update and delete the database or its table or data

what does it mean by structured --> it mean that the data in database is in structured way ==> like data in table form --> with specific
				    rows and coloum 

SQL VS MYSQL --> 

	1- SQL is query language and MySQL itself a RDBMS
	2- SQL is way to access data and MySQL we do CRUD on it using SQL
	

Install Mysql community server and mysql workbench

NOTE --> firstly its SQL is not a case-sensitive language but still its a good practice that we always make sql keyword always 
	 capital like --> create instead of this we do --> CREATE --> thats a good practice coz any other developer if see the 
	 code then he/she can easily identify which is sql keyword and which are not.

SOME SPECIFIC QUERY --> 

to create database -- > CREATE DATABASE temp;

to use specific database --> USE temp;

to make tabel in specific database --> 	USE temp
					CREATE TABLE student{
					id INT PRIMARY KEY,
					name VARCHAR(255)
					};

to insert data in specific table --> USE temp
				     INSERT INTO student VALUES(1, 'Gourav');

to select or get output that of specific query -->  USE temp
